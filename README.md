# Krish's Personal Portfolio Website

Hi! Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Website!

Here is a screenshot of the Landing of my Website:

This project is being hosted at: https://krishkochar.com


The website was developed using React and NodeJS, along with some HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
It is being hosted using Google Firebase.


To run the app in development mode: 
```console
npm start
```

To create a build for the app:
```console
npm run build
```

To deploy the app to Firebase create a build and run:
```console
firebase init 
firebase deploy
```


### Fixes Pending to the website:
- Skills page needs to be refactored. It is currently out of date.
- Contact Form feature is currently still a little slow. The backend server takes time to restart after a period of inactivity.
- Front-End is not responsive to varied screen sizes. Needs to be modified to work on native devices.
