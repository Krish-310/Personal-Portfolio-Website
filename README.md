This project is being hosted at: https://krish-personal-website.web.app/


The website was developed using React and NodeJS, along with some HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
It is being hosted using Google Firebase.


To run the app in development mode: 
```console
npm start
```

To create a build for the app:
```console
npm run build
```

To deploy the app to Firebase create a build and run:
```console
firebase init 
firebase deploy
```


### Fixes Pending to the website:
- Contact Form feature is currently not functional. Need to use AWS Lambda to make the serverless form work.
- Projects section is still a work in progress!
- Front-End is not responsive to varied screen sizes. Needs to be modified to work on native devices.
