          Hello! <br/> <br/>
          My name is Krish Kochar, and I am a student starting his second year at the University of Waterloo.
          I'm majoring in Computer Science and am enrolled in the Co-op programme. 
          <br/> <br/>
          My interests lie in the fields of Software Dev, Full-Stack Dev, AI & ML, and more. Over the past year, 
          I have been exploring these areas, and very much look forward to exploring many other such areas in 
          the future.

          <br/><br/><br/>
          You can find me on Social Media!
